# CV version 3

CV version 3, a repo to test and learn AWS. Not a rebuild of CV version 2 but a migration from a Vercel Deploy to an AWS deploy. 

Ideas for the move:
- Learn how to deploy a simple vue.js app to AWS
- Move the hard coded data storage to a database, potentially PostgreSQL
- Develop the Photography portfolio
