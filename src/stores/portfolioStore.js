  <p>This is the final project for Coding Bootcamps Europe, created by me and two of my classmates. It is a travel planning app made for easily sharing travel information with a group of travellers, such as flight itineraries or hotel locations.</p>

  <p>I handled the graphic design and drew the cat logo using Figma. My main priority was to ensure that all user interactions were easy, with large buttons, clear color distinctions between functions, and consistent use of colors for easy identification. The color scheme was inspired by my dad’s 1980s tennis racket.</p>

  <p>For the cat logo, I wanted it to resemble a confused tourist who accidentally wandered onto the busiest shopping street instead of the Museum of Cultural History, which they were actually looking for.</p>

  <p>Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Vue.js, MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, Render, Git, Figma, RESTful API</p>

Initially, I envisioned launching my own independent online shop called Red Leaf Cameras and created this draft for it. However, after some research, I concluded that it would be easier to utilize an existing platform. This ultimately resulted in my Etsy store, which I named 'No Fear of too many Cameras.'</p>

<p>I aimed for the store to be simple, primarily focusing on the images of the cameras. I wanted to minimize distractions and ensure that nothing interfered with the photographs. The rationale behind this approach is that, when buying vintage cameras, the images convey 99% of the story.</p>`,
